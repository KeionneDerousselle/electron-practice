What can Electron do?
    offers access to the native operating system
    offline by default
        support for this is much more natural than on the web
    node and node native modules
    no cross browser concerns
    access to host machine binaries
    GUI for testing
    

How it works
    Electron consists of multiple processes
    There are two types:
        Main
        Renderer
    There is only one main process and it acts as the main controller of the app
        it manages the application lifecycle and is headless (no UI) 
        it is in charge of spawning new render processes
    There can be multiple render processes
        Each render process is usually represented in the app by a UI Window
        this is the part of electron app that users will see and interact with
        render processes, while usually visual, can be used to create other processes for concurrent work
    Each processe type (Renderer and Main) has it's own API
    There are different modules provided in electron that are available or unavailable depending on what kind of process your code is running in
    There is a mechanism for those processes to coordinate and communicate with each other known as IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
    Both Main and Renderer Processes get their own IPC module
    Each IPC module is an instance of Node's event emitter, thus the APIs for this IPC modules feel like most other Pub_Sub APIs
    IPC lifecycle  
        renderer sends ipc.send('some event');
        main process is listening for ipc.on('some event') and performs some function as a result
        main process fires render.webContents.send('processing')
        renderer process listens to ipc.on('processing') and performs some function as a result
